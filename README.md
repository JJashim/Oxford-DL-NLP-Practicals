These are my ongoing practical works for the [Oxfordâ€™s Course Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing  (2017)](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017). It is focused on performing task based text embedding i.e., learning word embed vectors while performing text classification. The text classification are done using NN, LSTM and Bi-Directional LSTM using tensorflow. As well as embedded word vector visualisation using T-SNE.    
I have provided my *inferences* within the notebook.

**Dataset**: TED dataset (Textual content) - Multiclass classification.

**All the practicals are done in Tensorflow**
